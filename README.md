# Object Pool Example Repository

This repository contains an example implementation of the Object Pool design pattern in Kotlin. The code demonstrates how to manage a pool of welding arms effectively using the Object Pool pattern.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `src` directory.
2. Open the `Main.kt` file to see a demonstration of the `WeldingArmPool` class.
3. Explore the `WeldingArmPool.kt` file to understand the implementation details of the Object Pool pattern.

## Classes

### Main.kt

This file contains the main function demonstrating the usage of the `WeldingArmPool` class. It creates a pool of welding arms, borrows arms from the pool, and returns them after use.

### WeldingArmPool.kt

This file defines the `WeldingArmPool` class, which implements the Object Pool pattern. It manages a pool of welding arms, allowing users to borrow arms from the pool and return them after use.

## How to Run

To run the code:

1. Ensure you have Kotlin installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory.
3. Run the `Main.kt` file.
